            <h1 style="color: #8979D8;">Our Story</h1>
            <p>A year ago, we came across an article regarding children dying 
                in ERs due to staff being unprepared to treat younger patients. 
                This drove us to imagine a solution to both encourage hospitals 
                to gather tools and information necessary to minimize child 
                deaths in the operating room as well as inform parents about 
                which hospitals have emergency rooms ready to take their 
                children. To bring this idea to life, we brought together 
                a team and designed a website to rank ERs based on their 
                ability to treat young patients, because we understand the 
                feeling of concern when a hospital does not meet the 
                requirements of standard care all too well.</p>

            <h1 style="color: #8979D8;">Our Mission</h1>
            <p>
                We are dedicated to helping kids nationally get the treatment 
                they need. As a team, we analyzed data from various hospitals' 
                emergency departments to understand what was causing these 
                death rates. We came to the conclusion that hospitals were 
                unprepared for patients under the age of 18. This led us to 
                measure pediatric readiness using a set of criteria created 
                with data self-reported by hospitals, which we input into a 
                website to rank how prepared operating rooms are for these 
                patients. We hope that this will help us reach our goal to 
                save the lives of children all over the United States through 
                a user-friendly website.
